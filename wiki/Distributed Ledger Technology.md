## Distributed Ledger Technology is: 

### Consensus 

In general, a consensus algorithm is a process in computer science used to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed processes or systems. Consensus algorithms are designed to achieve reliability in a network involving multiple unreliable nodes. Solving that issue – known as the consensus problem – is important in distributed computing and multi-agent systems.

#### Cross-border payments

Developers argue that certain attributes of DLT, such as the ability to share ledgers across geographic distances and time-zones, could reduce the number of intermediaries needed to effect cross-border payments. By reducing the number of intermediaries, certain regional banks may be able to directly access the network, resulting in a more transparent and efficient cost structure for cross-border payments. Some of these cost savings could then potentially be passed onto their customers.[2]


#### Information sharing 

DLT has the ability to maintain tamper-resistent records. DLT arrangements could be designed to allow participants to have "read-only access" to certain parts of the common ledger. The users shouldn't be allowed to access or be able to write on the ledger, when it is not a neccessary part of the business flow. Because of the visibility, the integrity is being stressed and there is bigger confidence in the technology, since you are able to see the supply chain of a particular asset or its history. At the same time, however, since not all of a service provider’s transactions with a customer, or information about a customer, might be on one or any distributed ledger, certain regulatory requirements could be difficult to meet by simply providing access to a ledger.[2]

#### Industry approaches to adopting DLT

* Projects by financial institutions 

* Product development by technology firms

* Partnership between technology firms and financial institutions. 

* Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) partnerships.

* Participation in consortia. 

* Hosting or supporting business development programs for startups. 

#### Business issues: 

* __Cost-benefit considerations of potential use cases__ - key challange is to identify the appropriate use cases where the potential reduction in cost and effort would justify the investment of time and money into the new technology. 

* __Network effects__ - problem with early adopters because there is no network, yet.

#### Technical issues 
 - __Scalability__ - ledgers that add transactional histories on top of one another, such as blockchains, may challendge storage capacity over time. Also having effect over the transaction speed.  
 - __Interoperability__ - Through times different DLT systems have to cooperate, and there may be the case where legacy systems have to cooperate with newly made ones. Also diverse set of particiants interacting in the respective systems. So for the user to be able to use smoothly the relevant system will be of critical importance. 
 - __Standards development__ - needed for providing base layer of interoperability across different DLT arrangements and legacy systems. Consistency. 
 - __Cryptographic key and acccess data management__ - If the keys are lost, it may result in permanent lost of the data for the user as well.

 - __Information Management__ - user access and actions control. Control over erros or known fraudulent account take-overs. 

 #### Financial design issues 
 - __Financial instruments__ 
 - __Monetary instruments__   
 - __Financial intermediaries__
