It is going to be a Hyperledger Fabric & Composer manual, mainly because I got tired of always searching for something, finding it when I don't need it and then **puff** never can I find it again. 

#### What is Distributed Ledger Technology ? 
A distributed ledger is a database that is consensually shared and synchronized across network spread across multiple sites, institutions or geographies. It allows transactions to have public "witnesses," thereby making a cyberattack more difficult. The participant at each node of the network can access the recordings shared across that network and can own an identical copy of it. Further, any changes or additions made to the ledger are reflected and copied to all participants in a matter of seconds or minutes. Underlying the distributed ledger technology is the blockchain, which is the technology that underlies bitcoin.[1] Click [here](https://github.com/xxLestadxx/Dissertation/wiki/Distributed-Ledgers) to learn a bit more.
