Implementing a healthcare-based business network 

#### Desinging the Model : 

In this scenario we need 6 types participants, 7 types of assest, 9 types transaction. For naming convention each element (Participant, Asset, Transaction) of business network will have a different name in the model file. However, to understand what naming convention has been maintained in code, here we have used bracket (Pharmacy has been maintaned as Vendor in source code).
